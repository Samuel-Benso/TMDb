# Finding IDs for API Requests

Many TMDb API endpoints require specific IDs, such as movie IDs, TV show IDs, person IDs, and more. This guide will help you retrieve these IDs efficiently.

## Movie and TV Show IDs
To find a movie or TV show ID, use the **Search API**:

```bash
GET /search/movie?query=your_movie_name&api_key=YOUR_API_KEY
GET /search/tv?query=your_tv_show_name&api_key=YOUR_API_KEY
```

### Example Response:
```json
{
  "results": [
    {
      "id": 550,
      "title": "Fight Club"
    }
  ]
}
```
The `id` field (e.g., `550`) is the Movie ID you need.

## Person (Actor, Director, etc.) IDs
To get an actor's or director's ID, use the **Person Search API**:

```bash
GET /search/person?query=your_person_name&api_key=YOUR_API_KEY
```

### Example Response:
```json
{
  "results": [
    {
      "id": 287,
      "name": "Brad Pitt"
    }
  ]
}
```
The `id` field (e.g., `287`) is the Person ID.

## Collection IDs
Some movies belong to collections, and you can retrieve collection IDs via the **Movie Details API**:

```bash
GET /movie/{movie_id}?api_key=YOUR_API_KEY
```

### Example Response:
```json
{
  "id": 550,
  "title": "Fight Club",
  "belongs_to_collection": {
    "id": 2344,
    "name": "Fight Club Collection"
  }
}
```
The `id` inside `belongs_to_collection` (e.g., `2344`) is the Collection ID.

## Genre IDs
To fetch available genres and their IDs, use the **Genres API**:

```bash
GET /genre/movie/list?api_key=YOUR_API_KEY
GET /genre/tv/list?api_key=YOUR_API_KEY
```

### Example Response:
```json
{
  "genres": [
    {
      "id": 28,
      "name": "Action"
    }
  ]
}
```
The `id` (e.g., `28`) is the Genre ID.

## TV Season and Episode IDs
To get season and episode details, use the **TV Show Details API**:

```bash
GET /tv/{tv_id}/season/{season_number}?api_key=YOUR_API_KEY
GET /tv/{tv_id}/season/{season_number}/episode/{episode_number}?api_key=YOUR_API_KEY
```

### Example Response:
```json
{
  "id": 1101,
  "episodes": [
    {
      "id": 23456,
      "name": "Pilot"
    }
  ]
}
```
The `id` (e.g., `23456`) is the Episode ID.

## Alternative Method: TMDb Website
You can also manually find IDs by searching for a movie, TV show, or person on [TMDb](https://www.themoviedb.org/) and checking the URL:
- Movie: `https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/550` â†’ ID = `550`
- TV Show: `https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/1101` â†’ ID = `1101`
- Person: `https://www.themoviedb.org/person/287` â†’ ID = `287`

## Conclusion
By using these methods, you can quickly obtain the required IDs for API requests. Be sure to store and manage these IDs efficiently to avoid unnecessary API calls. Happy coding! ðŸš€
